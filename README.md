Chatbot in Golang

## Overview

In this project I have created a chatbot web application in Go. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, type in sentences such as “Hi, my name is John.” and the web application will reply with sentences such as “Hello John, how are you?” 

## Contents

1. data folder, containing eliza responses
2. eliza folder containing my code for reading and responding to user input,
also contains my "reflections" 
3. static folder containing my index.html and my javascript file
4. main.go, contining my main method. Deals with http requests.
5. This readMe file
6. MIT licence

## Motivation


## Installation

This repository can be found at https://github.com/DamianGavin/projectEliza

## Running the code

First you must have "Go" on your computer. This can be found and downloaded at https://golang.org/.
If you navigate to the folder that contains these files you can type :
go run  .\main.go to run the code.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
**EXAMPLE**
